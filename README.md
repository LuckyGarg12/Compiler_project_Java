# Java Compiler Project

This project implements a simple compiler in Java. The compiler takes source code written in a custom programming language (or a subset of Java) and compiles it into an intermediate representation or executable code. This project covers various stages of a compiler, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizes the input source code into a sequence of tokens.
- **Parsing**: Builds a syntax tree from the sequence of tokens.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Ensures the syntax tree adheres to the semantic rules of the language.
- **Intermediate Representation**: Converts the syntax tree into an intermediate representation.
- **Code Generation**: Generates machine-readable code or bytecode from the intermediate representation.
- **Error Handling**: Provides detailed error messages for common syntax and semantic errors.

## Requirements

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven (optional, if using Maven for project management)
- JDK and IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
